3229	1980	供心为一脑外伤患者,取心时呼吸巳停,施行气管内插管,人工呼吸,心脏跳动良好。供心取出至复跳共冷灌注保存3小时30分,心脏移植时间69分,循环开放后供心除	The heart donor was a brain trauma patient. By the time of heart procurement, breathing had ceased. Endotracheal intubation was performed and artificial respiration [established]. The heart beat well. The donor heart was procured …
3528	1994	供心摘取:全麻气管插管下,维持循环呼吸.前胸正中纵切口入路,建立经升主动脉灌注冷心肌保护液系统,放置上、下腔静脉结扎线。全身	Donor heart extraction: under general anesthesia tracheal intubation, maintain circulatory ventilation.
0573	1995	术前1h给供体静脉注射肝素3mg/kg。自第4肋间横断胸骨进胸,剪开心包,见心脏跳动微弱,心肌紫给,经气管插管辅助呼吸后,心肌转红,心脏搏动转为有力。自升主动脉根部插针灌注4℃的冷停跳液1000ml。。。5.1关于供心保护供心的保护直接关系到移植心脏的成败。对于脑死亡的供者,自主呼吸丧失,心肌缺氧,在这紧急情况下,必须在紧急开胸的同时,进行紧急气管插管及辅助呼吸,以维持心脏的血液循环和氧供,缩短心脏的热缺血时间。本文供体开胸时,胸壁切口已苍白无血迹,心脏己紫给,跳动微弱,但于气管插管供氧后心脏搏动迅即转为有力。取供心时自第4肋间切断胸骨进胸,速度快,显露良好,在野外操作无电源不能进行胸骨锯开的情况下采用此切口不失为一良好选择。本文从开胸到供心取出,耗时仅3min。	The donor was intravenously injected with heparin 3mg/kg 1h before the operation. The sternum was transected from the 4th intercostal space into the chest, and the pericardium cut open. The heartbeat was weak and the myocardium was purple. After assisted ventilation through tracheal intubation, the myocardium turned red and the heartbeat turned strong. A needle at the root of the ascending aorta was used to perfuse with 1000ml of cold cardioplegic solution at 4c°… 5.1 About donor heart protection. The protection of the donor heart is directly related to the success or failure of the transplanted heart. For brain-dead donors with loss of autonomic respiration and myocardial hypoxia, emergency tracheal intubation and assisted respiration must be performed in this emergency situation while opening the chest to maintain the circulation and oxygen supply to the heart and shorten the thermal ischemia time of the heart. When the chest of the donor in this paper was opened, the chest wall incision was pale and bloodless, and the heart was purple and beating weakly. But the heartbeat became strong immediately after tracheal intubation and oxygenation. The donor heart was extracted with an incision from the 4th intercostal sternum into the chest, which is fast and well exposed. This incision is a good choice for field operation where the sternum cannot be sawed open without power. In this paper, it took only 3 min from the opening of the chest to the removal of the donor heart.
3666	1997	供体脑死亡后,尽快气管插管人工呼吸并迅速开胸,速作升主动脉、肺动脉灌注冷停搏液,压力分别为11kPa(83mmHg)、6.67kPa(50mmH	After donor brain death, tracheal intubation was performed as soon as possible for artificial ventilation.
