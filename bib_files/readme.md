The bib files for this project are in this folder.

For simplicity and convenience, we decided to go with English-only references in the original publication. 

We experimented with both Chinese and English, but forcing them to conform to the AMA citation guidelines became increasingly unwieldy. For full transparency, we've simply preserved the initial bib file in this folder (`bib_files/dead_donor_references_original.bib`).

Anyone so interested is able to simply open the bib file in their favourite text editor, and ctrl+f for the references of interest. The final file -- `/code/dead_donor_references.bib` has English only, but has the same bibtex keys.

The code that shows how the file `dead_donor_references_original.bib` got transformed is in `code/helper_clean_references.R`.

If you have any questions simply email the authors.
