Protection of donor heart. Brain death is characterized by loss of voluntary respiration, and if artificial respiration is sought to be established in this particular state and within a limited time, it is possible to maintain the continuation of circulation and blood supply to the heart; avoiding or shortening the time of thermal ischemia to reduce ischemic damage is particularly important for the protection of donor heart. Therefore, after confirming brain death, there is no rush to open the chest to remove the heart, but [instead] strive to re-establish ventilation and maintain circulation to shorten the warm ischemia time, and even avoid the occurrence of warm ischemia."
